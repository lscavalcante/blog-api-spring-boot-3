## Configuration

The project provides several configuration options that can be customized according to your needs. The main configuration files are:

- `.env`: Contains the database configuration and jpa configuration
- `application.yml`: Contains configurations related to database connections, logging, etc.
- `SecurityConfiguration.java`: Configures the security aspects of the application using Spring Security.
- `JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`: Handles the JWT authentication process.
- `ChainExceptionHandlerFilter.java`: Handles unauthorized access exceptions.
- `GlobalExceptionHandler.java`: Handles exceptions and returns appropriate error responses.

Feel free to modify these files based on your project requirements.

## Usage

1. Register a new user by sending a `POST` request to `api/auth/createAccount` with the required information.
2. Obtain an access token by sending a `POST` request to `api/auth/login` with the user credentials. The response will include the access token.
3. Include the access token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests as a bearer token (`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`).
4. Access the protected endpoints by providing the valid access token.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is generated using Swagger. You can access it by visiting `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html` in your browser. The documentation provides details about the available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.
